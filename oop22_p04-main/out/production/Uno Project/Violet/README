Here are a couple different ways to run the program

1.
Open the package in an IDE such as Intellij. Build and run the Server.java and then the Client.java
Run as many Client.java's as you want to play the game.


2. open up \out\artifacts\Client_jar and \out\artifacts\Server_jar
copy the pathname for each of these and run them in a terminal
for example
java -jar <Copy pathname here>
